This javascript code generates electric field line diagrams from a user
prescribed set of electric charges.  In addition, the user can draw
equipotential surfaces (as this is a 2D projection the equipotential surfaces
are drawn as equipotential lines) as well as the corresponding electric-field
vectors at any point.  This tool was designed for beginning undergraduates
enrolled in my introduction to electricity and magnetism physics course.
However, I hope it may be useful for other students as well.

Instructions:<BR>
<ol>
<li> Choose the magnitude of charge (in Coulombs) from the "Select Charge" drop down menu. </li>
<li> Place the charge on the canvas by clicking on the desired location for the charge. </li>
<li> Continue to place charges on the canvas as desired.  The sign and magnitude of each subsequent charge can be chosen from the "Select Charge" menu. </li>
<li> When your are satisfied with the configuration of charges, set the number of field lines that will  emanate from a 1 Coulomb charge.  Also choose the relative precision of the calculation.  A precision of -2 means that the filed lines will have a relative error of one part in 100.</li>
<li> Select "Draw Field Lines" to compute and display the electric field lines.</li>
<li> Additionally, one can draw the electric field vector at a given point by first selecting "Draw Field Vector" and then clicking on the desired location on the canvas.  </li>
<li> The equipotential surface passing through a given point can be computed by selecting "Draw equipotential" and then clicking on the desired location on the canvas. </li>
<li> Choosing "Reverse Charges" will flip the sign of all charges on the canvas. </li>
<li> There is also the option to load a preset configuration of charges.  Selecting one of these presets will clear your current work.</li>
<li> The print command will open a new window containing a jpeg image of the canvas.  This jpeg can then be saved locally to your computer.
    <li> Note that the caveats discussed in the article <a href="AJP000714.pdf">Electric field line diagrams don't work</a> apply here as well. </li>
