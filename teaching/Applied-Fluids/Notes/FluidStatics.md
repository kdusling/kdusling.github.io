We gave the basic definition of pressure in the <a href="https://kdusling.github.io/teaching/Applied-Fluids/Notes/FluidProperties#pressure">previous section</a>.  *Pressure* is the force applied perpendicular to a surface per unit area.  When we speak of pressure we are typically dealing with a gas or a liquid that is confined to a container.  

$$
\mathrm{Pressure}=\frac{\mathrm{Force}}{\mathrm{Area}}\, \qquad\qquad p=\frac{F}{A}
$$

In the SI system a force per unit area has units of newtons per square meter $\N/\m^2$, which is called the pascal (Pa).  In the USCS a force per unit area has units of pound per square inch $lb/\in^2$ (psi).
