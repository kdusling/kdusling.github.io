We gave the basic definition of pressure in the <a href="https://kdusling.github.io/teaching/Applied-Fluids/Notes/FluidProperties#pressure">previous section</a>.  *Pressure* is the force applied perpendicular to a surface per unit area.  When we speak of pressure we are typically dealing with a gas or a liquid that is confined to a container.  

$$
\mathrm{Pressure}=\frac{\mathrm{Force}}{\mathrm{Area}}\, \qquad\qquad p=\frac{F}{A}
$$

In the SI system a force per unit area has units of newtons per square meter $\N/\m^2$, which is called the pascal (Pa).  In the USCS a force per unit area has units of pound per square inch $lb/\in^2$ (psi).

## Absolute and gauge pressure

The pressure when measured relative to an absolute vacuum is called the *absolute pressure*.  However a near absolute vacuum is difficult to obtain in practice and most pressure-measuring devices measure pressure relative to the local atmospheric pressure.  In this design the pressure gauge is calibrated to read zero when it is at atmospheric pressure and the pressure indicated is actually the difference between the absolute pressure and local atmospheric pressure.  This difference is called the gauge pressure and can be expressed as

$$
p_{\rm absolute}=p_{\rm gauge}+p_{\rm atm}
$$

The figure below summarizes the relationship between gauge and absolute pressure measurements.
