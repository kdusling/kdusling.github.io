# The nature of fluids

A *fluid* is a substance that continually deforms or flows under an applied shear stress.  While in common parlance a fluid typically refers to a liquid, in the sciences the term fluid can refer to a liquid or a gas.  For this course, our working definition of a *liquid* is a fluid that is incompressible ([see below](#Compressibility)).

The sections below will go through a number of physical properties that are commonly used to characterize fluids.  

## Density, specific weight & specific gravity

### Density

The *density* of the fluid is its mass per unit volume:
$$
\textrm{density}&=\textrm{mass}/\textrm{Volume}\\
$$

The density is represented by the Greek letter $\rho$ (rho).  If a quantity of fluid has a mass $m$ and a volume $V$, its density can be expressed as
$$
\rho&=m/V
$$

The units for density are $\kg/\m^3$ in the SI system and $\slugs/\ft^3$ in the U.S. Customary System.

### Specific weight

The *specific weight* of the fluid is its weight per unit volume:

$$
\textrm{specific weight}&=\textrm{weight}/\textrm{Volume}\\
$$

The specific weight is represented by the Greek letter $\gamma$ (gamma).  If a quantity of fluid has a weight $s$ and a volume $V$, its specific weight can be expressed as

$$
\gamma&=w/V
$$

The units for density are $\N/\m^3$ in the SI system and $\lb/\ft^3$ in the U.S. Customary System.

It is simple to convert between the density and specific weight.  Since the weight of a fluid is just its mass times gravity, $w=mg$ ($g$ being the acceleration due to gravity), the specific weight can be computed from the density via

$$
\gamma=\rho g
$$
