# The nature of fluids

{:toc}

A *fluid* is a substance that continually deforms or flows under an applied shear stress.  While in common parlance a fluid typically refers to a liquid, in the sciences the term fluid can refer to a liquid or a gas.  For this course, our working definition of a *liquid* is a fluid that is incompressible ([see below](#Compressibility)).

The sections below will go through a number of physical properties that are commonly used to characterize fluids.  

## Density, specific weight & specific gravity

### Density

The *density* of the fluid is its mass per unit volume:
$$
\textrm{density}=\textrm{mass}/\textrm{Volume}\\
$$

The density is represented by the Greek letter $\rho$ (rho).  If a quantity of fluid has a mass $m$ and a volume $V$, its density can be expressed as
$$
\rho&=m/V
$$

The units for density are $\kg/\m^3$ in the SI system and $\slug/\ft^3$ in the U.S. Customary System.

### Specific weight

The *specific weight* of the fluid is its weight per unit volume:

$$
\textrm{specific weight}=\textrm{weight}/\textrm{Volume}\\
$$

The specific weight is represented by the Greek letter $\gamma$ (gamma).  If a quantity of fluid has a weight $s$ and a volume $V$, its specific weight can be expressed as

$$
\gamma&=w/V
$$

The units for density are $\N/\m^3$ in the SI system and $\lb/\ft^3$ in the U.S. Customary System.

It is simple to convert between the density and specific weight.  Since the weight of a fluid is just its mass times gravity, $w=mg$ ($g$ being the acceleration due to gravity), the specific weight can be computed from the density via

$$
\gamma=\rho g
$$

### Specific gravity

It is often convenient to report the density or specific weight of a fluid with respect to a given reference fluid (water at $4\C$ will be used in this class).  The specific weight and density of water at $4\C$ is:
$$
\gamma=9.81~\text{kN}/\text{m}^3=62.4~\text{lb}/\text{ft}^3 \quad
\rho=1000~\text{kg}/\text{m}^3=1.94~\text{slugs}/\text{ft}^3
$$

The specific gravity of a substance is its density (or specific weight) divided by the density (or specific weight) of water at $4\C$.

In the SI system
$$
\begin{align}
sg&=\frac{\gamma}{9.81~\kN/\m^3}=\frac{\rho}{1000~\kg/\m^3} \quad \textrm{SI system}
sg&=\frac{\gamma}{62.4~\lb/\ft^3}=\frac{\rho}{1.94~\slug/\ft^3} \quad \textrm{USCS}
\end{align}
$$
