We will now expand the applicability of Bernoulli's equation to account for energy additions, removals and losses from pumps, motors and friction respectively.  We will continue to work in terms of *head* or the energy per unit weight of the fluid in the system.  

The general energy equation is

$$
\frac{p_1}{\gamma}+z_1+\frac{v_1^2}{2g}+h_A-h_R-h_L=\frac{p_2}{\gamma}+z_2+\frac{v_2^2}{2g} \qquad\qquad ({\rm Flow}: 1 \rightarrow 2)
\,,
$$

where

$$
\begin{align*}
h_A&= \text{energy added to the fluid by a pump} \\
h_R&= \text{energy removed from the fluid by a motor} \\
h_L&= \text{energy lost in the system due to friction}
\end{align*}
$$

## Power requirements and efficiency of pumps

The power transferred to the fluid by a pump is

$$
P_A=h_A W\,,
$$

where $W$ is the weight flow rate (having units of $\N/\s$ or $\lb/\s$).  Since $W=\gamma Q$ we can also express this as

$$
P_A=h_A \gamma Q\,.
$$

Not all of the input power to the pump is delivered to the fluid.
The mechanical efficiency $e_M$ of a pump is defined as

$$
e_M=\frac{\text{Power delivered to fluid}}{\text{Power input to pump}}=\frac{P_A}{P_I}
$$

The mechanical efficiency will always be less than 1.0.


<div class="example">

A manufacturer of a gear pump reports that 1.2 hp is required to pump 10 gpm of oil (sg=0.90) at a total head of 400 ft.  What is the efficiency (in percent) of this pump under these operating conditions?

<hr>

In this example the power input to the pump is 1.2 hp.  We first convert this into $\lbftovs$.

$$
P_I=1.2 ~\cancel{\text{hp}} \times\left(\frac{550~\lbftovs}{1~\cancel{\text{hp}}}\right)=660~\lbftovs
$$

The power delivered to the fluid will be calculated from $P_A=h_A \gamma Q$ where $h_A$ is the total head on the pump,

$$
\gamma = 0.9\times 62.4~\lb/\ft^3=56.2~\lb/\ft^3\,,
$$

and

$$
Q=10~\cancel{\text{gpm}}\left(\frac{1~\ft^3/\s}{449~\cancel{\text{gpm}}}\right)=0.0223~\ft^3/\s\,.
$$

Putting this together we find that the power delivered to the fluid is

$$
P_A=h_A \gamma Q = \left(400~\ft\right) \left(56.2~\lb/\ft^3\right) \left(0.0223 ~\ft^3/\s\right)=501~\lbftovs
$$

and converting back to horsepower:

$$
P_A=501~\cancel{\lbftovs} \times\left(\frac{1~\text{hp}}{550~\cancel{\lbftovs}}\right)=0.91~\hp
$$

The mechanical efficiency of the pump is

$$
e_M=\frac{P_A}{P_I}=\frac{0.91~\hp}{1.2~\hp}=0.76=76\%
$$

## Power requirements and efficiency of motors

The energy delivered by the fluid to a motor or turbine is denoted in the general energy equation by $h_R$.  The power delivered to the motor from the fluid is

$$
P_R=h_R W = h_R \gamma Q
$$

Just as for pumps not all of the energy delivered to the motor is ultimately converted to useful power output.  The mechanical efficiency $e_M$ for a motor is defined as

$$
e_M=\frac{\text{Power output from motor}}{\text{Power delivered to motor}}=\frac{P_O}{P_R}
$$

<div class="example">

A hydroelectric power plant receives water at a rate of $50~\m^3/\s$ from an elevation of $75~\m$. The power is generated by a turbine-generator having an efficiency of 85\%.  Neglecting frictional losses in the piping what is the power output of this plant?

<hr>

The power delivered to the fluid is

$$
P_R=h_R W = h_R \gamma Q = \left(76~\m\right)\left(9.81~\kN/\m^3\right)\left(50~\m^3/\s\right)=37,300~\text{kW}=37~\text{MW}
$$

Not all of the power delived to the motor by the fluid is converted into useful output power.  In this case the power output of the turbine-generator is

$$
P_O=e_M P_R = \left(0.85\right)\left(37~\text{MW}\right)=32~\text{MW}
$$
