In this section we will apply the conservation of energy principle to a moving fluid.  Imagine an element of fluid, as shown below, moving in a pipe with a velocity $v$.  The fluid element has a pressure $p$, and is located at a distance $z$ above some reference elevation.

The fluid element has these three forms of energy:

1. kinetic energy $\frac{1}{2}w v^2/g$$

2. potential energy $=wz$

3.  pressure energy = $wp/\gamma$

Now imagine this fluid element moving through a system.  As it travels from point 1 to 2 the total energy of the fluid element must remain unchanged. However, one

The assumptions include

+ The flow is steady
+ The fluid is incompressible
+ No losses due to friction
+ No heat addition or removal
+ No pumps or motors that add or remove energy from the system  

the potential energy, kinetic energy and pressure energy.


$$
\frac{p_1}{\gamma}+z_1+\frac{v_1^2}{2g}=\frac{p_2}{\gamma}+z_2+\frac{v_2^2}{2g}
$$
