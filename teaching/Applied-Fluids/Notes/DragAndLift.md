# Drag and Lift

{:toc}

An object moving through a fluid will experience a complicated set of forces acting on it.  In order to understand the behavior of the object as it moves through the fluid, we will focus on two resultant forces--drag and lift.
The drag force acts parallel to the motion of the object while the lift force acts in a direction perpendicular to the motion.  

Instead of considering an object moving through a fluid at rest, we can consider the same object at rest in a fluid stream of the same velocity.  The object will experience the same set of forces as illustrated in the picture below.  In this case the drag and lift forces will act parallel and perpendicular to the velocity of the fluid.

## Drag Force equation

The drag force on an object is

$$
F_D=C_D \left(\frac{\rho v^2}{2}\right) A
$$

In the above expression, $C_D$ is a dimensionless number known as the drag coefficient.  $\rho$ is the density of the fluid.  $v$ is the free stream velocity of the fluid relative to the body.  $A$ is a *characteristic area* of the body and will be defined carefully for each object in the subsequent sections.  It is usually taken as the largest cross-sectional area of the body perpendicular to the flow, also known as the projected area.

The combined term $\rho v^2/2$ is called the *dynamic pressure*.  Note that the drag force is proportional to the dynamic pressure and therefore the velocity squared.  If the velocity increases by a factor of two the drag force will increase by a factor of four.

The drag coefficient, $C_D$, depends on the shape and orientation of the body.  It also depends on the Reynolds number and the roughness of the object's surface.  It can also be influenced by other bodies in the vicinity of the object.  Ultimately the drag coefficient will be taken from experimental data.  

## Friction vs pressure drag

The drag force on an object is usually divided into two components; *friction drag* and *pressure drag* (also called *form drag*).  The friction drag is due to the friction between the fluid and the surface of the object.  The pressure drag is sensitive to the shape of the object and how the fluid separates from the boundary of the object.  The total drag is the sum of these two contributions.

<div class="example">

Monica Seles serves a tennis ball without spin at a velocity of 85 mph.  If the ball has a diameter of 2.56 inches, estimate the drag force on the ball.  For this exercise you may treat the tennis ball as a smooth sphere.

<hr>

The drag force is calculated using

$$
F_D=C_D \left(\frac{\rho v^2}{2}\right) A
$$

In the above expression $\rho=2.377\times 10^{-3}~\slug/\ft^3$ is the density of air at STP. (I got this number from <a href="https://kdusling.github.io/teaching/Applied-Fluids/AtmosphereProperties.html">here</a> by entering 0 feet elevation).  The velocity is  $v=85~\textrm{mph} =  125~\textrm{fps}$.

The area $A$ is the *projected area* of the sphere.

$$
A=\pi D^2/4=\pi/4\left(2.56~\inch\right)^2=5.147~\inch^2 = 0.0357~\ft^2
$$

The last step is to find the drag coefficient. In order to do this first compute the Reynolds number

$$
Re=\frac{vD}{\nu}=\frac{125~\ft/s \times 0.213~\ft}{1.572\times 10^{-4}~\ft^2/s}=1.7\times 10^5
$$

The kinematic viscosity of air was taken from <a href="https://kdusling.github.io/teaching/Applied-Fluids/AtmosphereProperties.html">the same link as above</a>.  For a smooth sphere I find $C_D=0.46$. You can estimate this from the graph above or by using an <a href="https://kdusling.github.io/teaching/Applied-Fluids/DragCoefficient.html">online calculator</a>. Putting everything together the drag force is

$$
F_D=C_D \left(\frac{\rho v^2}{2}\right) A = 0.46\left(\frac{0.002377 (125)^2}{2}\right) 0.0357 = 0.3~\lb
$$

According to [Mehta, R., Alam, F. and Subic, A. (2008), <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/jst.11">Review of tennis ball aerodynamics.</a> Sports Technol., 1: 7-16. https://doi.org/10.1002/jst.11] the drag coefficient for a tennis ball is closer to 0.6 or 30&#37; larger than the smooth sphere. This will result in a drag force about 30&#37; larger.

## Lift and drag on airfoils

The lift force on an airfoil is given as

$$
F_L=C_L \left(\rho v^2/2\right) A
$$

where $C_L$ is a dimensionless lift coefficient that primarily dependent on the shape of the airfoil and its angle of attack.  Keep in mind that it can also depend on the Reynolds number, Mach number, surface roughness, and the aspect ratio.  The area, $A$, is taken as the span of the airfoil multiplied by the chord.

$$
F_D=C_D \left(\rho v^2/2\right) A
$$
