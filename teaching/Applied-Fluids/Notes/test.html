<h1 class="title">Minor Losses</h1>
</header>
<span class="math display">\[\require{cancel}\]</span>
<p>Energy losses through valves, bends, expansions, contractions, gauges, flow meters, etc, are generally referred to as <em>minor losses</em>. Note that the cumulative effect of a number of <em>minor losses</em> can be substantial.</p>
<p>Energy losses are proportional to the velocity head near the component of interest. The energy loss through a component can be expressed as <span class="math display">\[ h_L=K\left(\frac{v^2}{2g}\right) \]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(h_L\)</span> is the minor loss, <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span> is the resistance coefficient and <span class="math inline">\(v\)</span> is the average velocity in the pipe in the vicinity of the component. The velocity that is used in the above expression will depend on the specific problem.</p>
<h2 id="sudden-enlargement">Sudden Enlargement</h2>
<p>As fluid flows through an enlargement the decrease in velocity (think continuity eqn) is accompanied by an increase in pressure (think Bernoulli's eqn). If the enlargement is sharp or sudden regions of turbulence develop in the corners of the larger pipe. The regions of turbulence result in the dissipation of kinetic energy into internal energy. The energy loss (expressed as a loss of head) is written as <span class="math display">\[
h_L=K\left(\frac{v_1^2}{2g}\right) \]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(v_1\)</span> is the velocity in the <em>smaller</em> section of pipe.</p>
<figure>

</figure>
<p>Under some <a href="http://www.nptel.ac.in/courses/112104118/lecture-14/14-6_losses_sudden_enlarg.htm">simplifying assumptions the resisiteve coefficient can be derived</a>:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ K\approx \left[1-\frac{A_1}{A_2}\right]^2 \]</span> The above expression works fairly well for moderate velocities and is a reasonable starting point for estimating losses due to a sudden expansion. If the sudden transition between pipe sizes can be made more gradual the energy loss can be reduced. A <em>diffuser</em> converts kinetic energy to pressure energy by a gradual enlargement in pipe size.</p>
<h3 id="exit-loss">Exit Loss</h3>
<p>When a fluid flows from a pipe into a large tank or reservoir all of the kinetic energy is dissipated (the kinetic energy in the static tank is zero). This can be treated as a limiting case of sudden expansion by taking <span class="math inline">\(A_1\to 0\)</span> in our expression for the resistive coefficient. This results in <span class="math inline">\(K\to 1\)</span> and a head loss of <span class="math display">\[
h_L=1.0\left(\frac{v_1^2}{2g}\right) \]</span></p>
<figure>

</figure>
<h2 id="sudden-contraction">Sudden Contraction</h2>
<p>A sudden contraction in a pipe results in a drop in pressure due to the sudden increase in velocity and the loss of energy due to turbulence. The energy loss (expressed as a loss of head) is written as <span class="math display">\[
h_L=K\left(\frac{v_2^2}{2g}\right) \]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(v_2\)</span> is the velocity in the <em>smaller</em> section of pipe downstream of the contraction.</p>
<p>The mechanism of energy loss in a contraction is much more complex than that of an expansion. The cartoon below shows the path of the flow stream. Regions of turbulence develop both before the contraction and after the contraction. The region where the cross-section is minimum is known as the <em>vena contracta</em>.</p>
<p>A number of empirical equations for the resistance coefficient for sudden contraction can be found in the literature. One of the <a href="http://amzn.to/2hla1qx">simplest I found</a> is a good starting point for rough estimates of losses in sudden contractions. <span class="math display">\[ K\approx
0.5\left[1-\frac{A_2}{A_1}\right] \]</span> In practice however more accurate resistive coefficients should be taken from other resources such as <a href="http://amzn.to/2zzrC8C">CRANE Technical Paper 410</a>.</p>

<h3 id="entrance-loss">Entrance Loss</h3>
<p>The losses that occur when a fluid flows from a larger reservoir or tank into a pipe are called <em>entrance losses</em>. For a square-edged inlet as shown in the cartoon below the resistive coefficient is <span class="math inline">\(K\approx0.5\)</span>. This is the limiting case of <span class="math inline">\(A_1\to \infty\)</span> in the equation for <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span> above. Chamfered and rounded inlets have smaller resistance coefficients. For a chamfered inlet <span class="math inline">\(K\approx 0.25\)</span> and for a well-rounded inlet <span class="math inline">\(K\approx 0.04\)</span>.</p>

</figure>
<h2 id="valves-and-fittings">Valves and Fittings</h2>
<p>The same formula is applied for losses though a valve or fitting <span class="math display">\[
h_L=K\left(\frac{v^2}{2g}\right) \]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(v\)</span> is the velocity at the valve. The resistance coefficient is typically expressed as <span class="math display">\[
K=\left(L_e/D\right)f_T \]</span> where the factor <span class="math inline">\(\left(L_e/D\right)\)</span> is called the equivalent length ratio and is usually considered to be a constant for a given type of valve or fitting. Values for <span class="math inline">\(\left(L_e/D\right)\)</span> for some common types of valves and fittings is given in the <a href="#LeOverD">table below</a>. The term <span class="math inline">\(f_T\)</span> is the friction factor in the pipe to which the valve is connected taken in the zone of complete turbulence. The tables for <a href="../SteelPipeTable.html?sch=40&amp;mat=comSteel">Schedule 40</a> and <a href="../SteelPipeTable.html?sch=40&amp;mat=comSteel">Schedule 80</a> list the values of <span class="math inline">\(f_T\)</span> for commercial steel pipes.</p>

<p>The value of <span class="math inline">\(L_e\)</span> is called the equivalent length of pipe; it is the length of straight pipe that would produce the same loss as the valve. For example a 2&quot; fully open globe valve <span class="math inline">\((L_e/D=340)\)</span> has <span class="math inline">\(L_e \approx 57\~\mathrm{ft}\)</span>. This value of <span class="math inline">\(L_e\)</span> can than be added to the actual length of pipe to determine the total losses. While convenient, this procedure is only accurate when the actual pipe flows are in the zone of complete turbulence.</p>
