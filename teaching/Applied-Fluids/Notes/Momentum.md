## Forces due to fluids in motion

This chapter will study the forces generated by fluids in motion.
For example, a power washer produces a high velocity jet of water which produces a force large enough to remove debris.  Hurricane strength winds can produce forces large enough to destroy a home.  The nozzle of a firehose requires considerable strength to control.

The <a href="https://kdusling.github.io/teaching/Applied-Fluids/Notes/Continuity">continuity equation</a> was a consequence of conservation of mass.  <a href="https://kdusling.github.io/teaching/Applied-Fluids/Notes/Bernoulli">Bernoulli's equation</a> was a consequence of conservation of energy.
The forces described above are a consequence of conservation of momentum.  We don't have a special name for these equations and will just refer to them as the *momentum equations for a fluid*.

Newton's second law states that rate of change of momentum of a body is directly proportional to the force applied.  For steady flows this results to the following three force equations, one for each direction:

$$
F_x= \rho Q \Delta v_x \nonumber\\
F_y= \rho Q \Delta v_y \nonumber\\
F_z= \rho Q \Delta v_z
$$

In the above expression $F_x$ is the net force *acting on the fluid* in the x-direction.  This needs to be stressed:  $F_x$ is the sum of all forces (in the *x*-direction) acting on the fluid.  These forces may include reaction forces exerted from solid surfaces or from the fluid pressure itself (more on this later).  It is *not* the force which the fluid imparts on an object.  The next exercise will belabor this point as it is often a point of confusion.

The remaining quantities in the above force equation are the density, $\rho$ and the volume flow rate, $Q$.  The term, $\Delta v_x$, represents the change in the fluid velocity in the *x*-direction.  It is the fluid's final velocity in the *x*-direction minus the fluids initial velocity in the *x*-direction.


<div class="example">

A hose sprays a jet of water directly at a wall at a rate of 2 liters per second.  If the velocity of the stream is 8 m/s how much force is exerted on the wall by the water?

In this problem I will assume that the water does not reflect from the wall but simply comes to rest.  More realistically the fluid will be deflected from the wall in a direction along to the wall.  In either case the problem is solved by focusing on the change in momentum in one dimension, which we will call the $x$-direction.     

The momentum equation in the *x*-direction is:

$$
F_x= \rho Q \Delta v_x
$$

The fluid changes the *x*-component of its velocity when it hits the wall.  It goes from 8 m/s before hitting the wall to 0 m/s (in the *x*-direction) after contact.  The change in velocity (final minus initial) is therefore:

$$
\Delta v_x = v_{fx}-v_{ix}=0-8~\m/s = -8~\m/s.
$$

The momentum equation in the *x*-direction is:

$$
F_x= \rho Q \Delta v_x = \left(1000~\kg/\m^3\right) \left( 2~\L/s\right)\left(-8~\m/s\right)=-16~\N
$$

The minus sign tells us that the force is in the minus *x*-direction, *i.e.* to the left.  Remember, the force we solved for, $F_x$, is the force acting *on* the fluid.  In this problem the wall exerts a force of 16 N in the minus *x*-direction on the fluid.  Newton's third law then tells us that the fluid exerts a force of 16 N in the positive *x*-direction on the wall.
