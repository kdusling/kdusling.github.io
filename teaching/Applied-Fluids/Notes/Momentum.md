## Forces due to fluids in motion

This chapter will study the forces generated by fluids in motion.
For example, a power washer produces a high velocity jet of water which produces a force large enough to remove debris.  Hurricane strength winds can produce forces large enough to destroy a home.  The nozzle of a firehose requires considerable strength to control.

The <a href="https://kdusling.github.io/teaching/Applied-Fluids/Notes/Continuity">continuity equation</a> was a consequence of conservation of mass.  <a href="https://kdusling.github.io/teaching/Applied-Fluids/Notes/Bernoulli">Bernoulli's equation</a> was a consequence of conservation of energy.
The forces described above are a consequence of conservation of momentum.  We don't have a special name for these equations and will just refer to them as the *momentum equations for a fluid*.

Newton's second law states that rate of change of momentum of a body is directly proportional to the force applied.  For steady flows this results to the following three force equations, one for each direction:

$$
F_x= \rho Q \Delta v_x \nonumber\\
F_y= \rho Q \Delta v_y \nonumber\\
F_z= \rho Q \Delta v_z
$$

In the above expression $F_x$ is the net force *acting on the fluid* in the x-direction.  This needs to be stressed:  $F_x$ is the sum of all forces (in the *x*-direction) acting on the fluid.  These forces may include reaction forces exerted from solid surfaces or from the fluid pressure itself (more on this later).  It is *not* the force which the fluid imparts on an object.  The next exercise will belabor this point as it is often a point of confusion.

The remaining quantities in the above force equation are the density, $\rho$ and the volume flow rate, $Q$.  The term, $\Delta v_x$, represents the change in the fluid velocity in the *x*-direction.  It is the fluid's final velocity in the *x*-direction minus the fluids initial velocity in the *x*-direction.


<div class="example">

A hose sprays a jet of water directly at a wall at a rate of 2 liters per second.  If the velocity of the stream is 8 m/s how much force is exerted on the wall by the water?

In this problem I will assume that the water does not reflect from the wall but simply comes to rest.  More realistically the fluid will be deflected from the wall in a direction along the wall.  In either case the problem is solved by focusing on the change in momentum in one dimension, which we will call the $x$-direction.     

The momentum equation in the *x*-direction is:

$$
F_x= \rho Q \Delta v_x
$$

The fluid changes the *x*-component of its velocity when it hits the wall.  It goes from 8 m/s before hitting the wall to 0 m/s (in the *x*-direction) after contact.  The change in velocity (final minus initial) is therefore:

$$
\Delta v_x = v_{fx}-v_{ix}=0-8~\m/s = -8~\m/s.
$$

The momentum equation in the *x*-direction is:

$$
F_x= \rho Q \Delta v_x = \left(1000~\kg/\m^3\right) \left( 2~\L/s\right)\left(-8~\m/s\right)=-16~\N
$$

The minus sign tells us that the force is in the minus *x*-direction, *i.e.* to the left.  Remember, the force we solved for, $F_x$, is the force acting *on* the fluid.  In this problem the wall exerts a force of 16 N in the minus *x*-direction on the fluid.  Newton's third law then tells us that the fluid exerts a force of 16 N in the positive *x*-direction on the wall.

<div class="example">

Compute the horizontal and vertical forces on the block shown below.  The fluid is water with a velocity of 25 fps and a stream diameter of 1.75 inches.

In this example we will need to use the momentum equations in both the $x$ and $y$ directions.  Before we get started let's find the volume flow rate:

$$
Q=vA=25~\frac{\ft}{\s}\times \frac{\pi}{4}\left(\frac{1.75~\inch}{12~\inch/\ft}\right)^2=0.418~\ft^3/\s
$$

Now let's start with the *x*-direction:

$$
F_x= \rho Q \Delta v_x
$$

The initial *x*-component of the velocity is $v_{ix}=25$ fps.  The final component is $v_{fx} = -25\cos(30)=-21.65$ fps.  Note the minus sign since the final *x*-component of the velocity is to the left.

The change in velocity (final minus initial) is therefore:

$$
\Delta v_x = v_{fx}-v_{ix}=-21.65~\fps-25~\fps = -46.65~\fps.
$$

The momentum equation in the *x*-direction is:

$$
F_x= \rho Q \Delta v_x = \left(1.94~\slug/\ft^3\right) \left(0.418~\ft^3/\s\right)\left(-46.65~\fps \right)=-37.83~\lb
$$

The minus sign tells us that the force *on the fluid* is to the left.  The force on the block is therefor 37.38 lb to the right.

Now the *y*-direction:

$$
F_y= \rho Q \Delta v_y
$$

The initial *y*-component of the velocity is zero.  The final component is $v_{fy} = +25\sin(30) = 12.5~\fps$.  Note the plus sign since the final *y*-component of the velocity is up. The change in velocity (final minus initial) is:

$$
\Delta v_y = v_{fy}-v_{iy}=12.5~\fps - 0~\fps = 12.5~\fps.
$$

The force on the fluid in the *y*-direction is:

$$
F_y= \rho Q \Delta v_y = \left(1.94~\slug/\ft^3\right) \left(0.418~\ft^3/\s\right)\left(12.5~\fps \right)=10.14~\lb
$$

So the block experiences a force of $10.14~\lb$ downward. The figure below shows both the *x* and *y* force on the block as well as the resultant force.
