<h1> Curvilinear motion of particles </h1>

<h2> Position, Velocity, and Acceleration Vectors </h2>

<p>

Consider a particle that moves in the \(xy\) plane as shown below. At some time, \(t\), the particle is located at point \(P\). Its position is specified by the vector \(\vec{r}\) connecting the origin \(O\) and \(P\).

At some later time, \(t^\prime\), the particle is located at point \(P^\prime\) defined by vector \(\vec{r}^{\,\prime}\). The displacement of the particle from time \(t\) to \(t^\prime\) is given as

\begin{align*}
    \Delta\vec{r}=\vec{r}^{\,\prime}-\vec{r}
\end{align*}

The instantaneous velocity is defined as
\begin{align*}
    \vec{v}=\lim_{\Delta t\to 0 }\frac{\Delta\vec{r}}{\Delta t}=\frac{d\vec{r}}{dt}
\end{align*}
and is tangent to the path of the particle as shown in the figure below. Similarly the acceleration is given as
\begin{align*}
    \vec{a}=\frac{d{\vec v}}{dt}
\end{align*}

<h3> Rectangular Components of Velocity and Acceleration</h3>


<p>We can express the position vector \(\vec{r}\) of a particle in rectangular coordinates as</p>

\begin{align*}
    \vec{r} = x(t) \hat{i} + y(t)\hat{j}
\end{align*}

<p>
where \(\hat{i}\) and \(\hat{j}\) are the unit vectors in the \(x\) and \(y\) directions, respectively.  Differentiating with respect to \(t\) we find the following expression for the velocity and acceleration
</p>

\begin{align*}
     \vec{v} &= \frac{d\vec{r}}{dt} = \dot{x}(t) \hat{i} + \dot{y}(t)\hat{j}\\
    \vec{a} &= \frac{d\vec{v}}{dt} = \ddot{x}(t) \hat{i} + \ddot{y}(t)\hat{j}\\
\end{align*}

<p>It then follows that the scalar components of velocity and acceleration are</p>

\begin{align*}
    v_x&=\dot{x}(t)\,\qquad v_y=\dot{y}(t)\\
    a_x&=\ddot{x}(t)\,\qquad a_y=\ddot{y}(t)\\
\end{align*}

<h3>Projectile motion</h3>

 
<p>For the motion of a projectile the only force acting on the particle is that of gravity.  The components of the acceleration are therefore</p>

\begin{align*}
    a_x=\ddot{x}=0\qquad a_y=\ddot{y}=-g
\end{align*}

We can integrate to find the velocity and position

\begin{alignat*}{3}
    v_x(t)&=\dot{x}(t)=v_{x0} &\qquad& v_y(t)&=&\dot{y}(t)=v_{y0}-gt\\
    x(t)&=x_0+v_{x0}t &\qquad& ~~y(t)&=&y_0+v_{y0}t-\frac{1}{2}gt^2
\end{alignat*}

<h3>Motion Relative to a Frame in Translation</h3>


Consider two particles, $A$ and $B$.  In our \emph{fixed frame of reference} $O_{xy}$ particle $A$ and $B$ are located at $\vec{r}_A$ and $\vec{r}_B$, respectively.

Let us now consider another coordinate system whose origin coincides with the position of particle $A$. We call this coordinate system $A_{x^\prime y^\prime}$. We suppose that that while the origin of the axes move with particle $A$ their orientation remains unchanged ({\em i.e. }$x^\prime$ remains pointing right and $y^\prime$ always points up).

The position of particle $B$ in the moving frame $A$ is

\begin{align*}
    \vec{r}_B=\vec{r}_A+\vec{r}_{B/A}
\end{align*}

Taking time derivatives

\begin{align*}
    \vec{v}_B=\vec{v}_A+\vec{v}_{B/A}\\
    \vec{a}_B=\vec{a}_A+\vec{a}_{B/A}
\end{align*}
