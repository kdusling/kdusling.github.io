<h1> Curvilinear motion: Normal-Tangential Coordinates </h1>


<p>

In normal-tangential coordinates the particle itself serves as the origin point. The $t$ or tangential direction points in the direction of motion at that instant in time.  The unit vector in the $t$ direction is denoted as $\hat{e}_t$. By definition is magnitude is one but is direction changes as the particle moves along its path. 

The velocity vector can therefore be expressed as:
\begin{align}
    \vec{v}(t)=v(t)\hat{e}_t
\end{align}
where $v(t)$ is the speed of the particle at a given time.

We won't derive this here but the acceleration in this coordinate system is expressed as
\begin{align}
    \vec{a}=\frac{dv}{dt}\hat{e}_t+\frac{v^2}{\rho}\hat{e}_n
\end{align}
where $\hat{e}_n$ is a unit vector in the normal direction, pointing $90^\circ$ counterclockwise from the $t$-direction. $\rho$ is the radius of curvature of the path at the points current position. 

It will sometimes be convenient to represent the components of the acceleration as
\begin{align*}
    a_t=\frac{dv}{dt}\,,\qquad a_n=\frac{v^2}{\rho} 
\end{align*}
therefore
\begin{align}
    \vec{a}=a_t\hat{e}_t+a_n\hat{e}_n
\end{align}

<!--Need a discussion on 1/ direction of normal componenta and 2/ where normal acceleration comes from
