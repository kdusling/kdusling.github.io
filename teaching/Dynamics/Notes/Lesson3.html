<h1> Newton's 2nd Law </h1>

<p>
Newton's 2nd Law can be states as follows. 
A particle has an acceleration proportional to the resultant force acting on it. The direction of the acceleration is the same as the direction of the resultant force. The proportionality constant is the mass of the particle. This is more simply put by the following equation:
</p>


<div class="impeq">
<div class="impeq-title">Newton's 2nd Law</div>
<div class="impeq-content">
\begin{align*}
 \vec{F}=m\vec{a}
 \end{align*}
</div></div>

If we have multiple forces acting on the particle we can sum them as vectors:

<div class="impeq">
<div class="impeq-title">Newton's 2nd Law with multiple forces</div>
<div class="impeq-content">
\begin{align*}
 \sum \vec{F}=m\vec{a}
  \end{align*}
</div></div>

Note that if no forces are acting on a particle the acceleration must be zero and the velocity a constant. If the particle starts at rest it remains at rest and if it begins in motion it will remain in motion with that same velocity, until it is acted on by a force. So Newton's first law follows from Newton's second law.
