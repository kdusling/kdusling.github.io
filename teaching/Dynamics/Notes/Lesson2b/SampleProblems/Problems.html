<div class="question-content">


 A motorist is traveling on a curved section of highway of radius 2500 ft at the speed of 60 mi/hr. The motorist suddenly applies the brakes, causing the automobile to slow down at a constant rate. Knowing that after 8 sec the speed has been reduced to 45 mi/hr, determine the acceleration of the automobile immediately after the brakes are applied.

 A commercial jetliner is traveling a constant 250 m/s when it executes an emergency 180 degree turn. If the turn takes 20 seconds, what is the acceleration experienced by the passengers? What is the radius of the curve taken by the plane?

<div class="question-content">


        Assuming a cloverleaf interchange has a radius of curvature of 80 meters at the tightest part of the turn, what is the fastest a car could travel around this curve without experiencing more than \(0.5g\) in acceleration? Assume the car is traveling at a constant speed. If the car was instead increasing speed at a rate of \(2~\text{m/s}^2\), what would be the new overall magnitude of the acceleration experienced by the passengers?

<div class="question-content">
The motion of a particle is defined by the position vector

\begin{align*}
    \vec{r}=\left(1+6t^2-4t^3\right)\hat{i} + \left(3+4t\right)\hat{j}
\end{align*}

Determine the velocity and acceleration when (a) \(t=0\) and (b) \(t = 1\).
