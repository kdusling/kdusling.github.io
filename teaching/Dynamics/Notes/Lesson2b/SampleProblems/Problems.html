 A commercial jetliner is traveling a constant 560 mph when it executes an emergency 180 degree turn. If the turn takes 20 seconds, what is the acceleration experienced by the passengers? Hint: First find the radius of the path taken by the plane?

        Assuming a cloverleaf interchange has a radius of curvature of 80 meters at the tightest part of the turn, what is the fastest a car could travel around this curve without experiencing more than \(0.5g\) in acceleration? Assume the car is traveling at a constant speed. If the car was instead increasing speed at a rate of \(2~\text{m/s}^2\), what would be the new overall magnitude of the acceleration experienced by the passengers as they enter the turn?

<div class="question-content">

 A motorist is traveling on a curved section of highway of radius 2500 ft at the speed of 60 mi/hr. The motorist suddenly applies the brakes, causing the automobile to slow down at a constant rate. Knowing that after 8 sec the speed has been reduced to 45 mi/hr, determine the acceleration of the automobile immediately after the brakes are applied.
 
 
 <!--
\begin{align*}
        a_t=-2.75~\textrm{ft/s}^2
    \end{align*}
    
    \begin{align*}
        a_n=3.10~\textrm{ft/s}^2
    \end{align*}

    \begin{align*}
        \vec{a} =4.14~\textrm{ft/s}^2\quad 48.4^\circ
