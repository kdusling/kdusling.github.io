A girl operates a radio-controlled model car in a vacant parking lot. The girl's position is at the origin of the \(xy\) coordinate axes, and the surface of the parking lot lies in the \(xy\)  plane. She drives the car in a straight line so that the \(x\)  coordinate is defined by the relation \(x(t) = 0.5t^3 - 3t^2 + 3t + 2\), where \(x\) and \(t\) are expressed in meters and seconds, respectively. Determine (a) when the velocity zero, (b) the position and the total distance traveled when the acceleration is zero.

<div class="p-3">

	The position of the car is a given
	$$
	x(t) = 0.5t^3 - 3t^2 + 3t + 2
	$$

	We differentiate to find the velocity
	$$
	v=\frac{dx}{dt}=1.5t^2-6t + 3
	$$
	
	Part (a) asks us to find the times when \(v=0\)
	$$
	1.5t^2-6t + 3=0 \Longrightarrow t = 2 \pm \sqrt{2} = 0.586, 3.414
	$$
	
	Part (b) asks us to find stuff when the acceleration is zero. We differentiate to find the acceleration
	$$
	a=\frac{dv}{dt}=3t-6
	$$
	and set it to zero and solve
	$$
	3t-6=0\Longrightarrow t=2
	$$
	
	To find the position at \(t=2\) we used the previously given equation for position
	$$
	x(t=2) = 0.5(2)^3 - 3(2)^2 + 3(2) + 2 = 0
	$$
	
	To find the total distance traveled we need to separate the motion into the parts when the car is going forward and in reverse.
	The car is moving forward between times \(t=0\) and \(t=0.586\). The position of the car at these two times is \(x(t=0)=2\) and \(x(0.586)=2.828\). So the distance traveled in this first stage is \(s_{fwd}=x(t=0.586)-x(0)=2.828-2=0.828\).  The car moves backward between \(t=0.586\) and \(t=2\). So the distance traveled in this second stage is \(s_{rev}=x(t=0.586)-x(2)=2.828-0=2.828\).
	The total distance traveled is therefore \(s_{fwd}+s_{rev}=0.828+2.828=3.657\).
