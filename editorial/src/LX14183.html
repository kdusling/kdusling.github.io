<tr><td colspan="2">The $\beta$-decay half-lives of 108 neutron-rich isotopes of the
elements from $_{37}$Rb to $_{50}$Sn were measured at the Radioactive
Isotope Beam Factory (RIBF). The 41 new half-lives follow robust
systematics and highlight the persistence of shell effects. The new
data have direct implications for $r$-process calculations and reinforce
the notion that the second ($A\approx130$) and the rare-earth-element
($A\approx160$) abundance peaks may result from the freezout of an
$\nggn$ equilibrium. In such equilibrium, the new half-lives are likely
to determine the abundance of rare-earth elements, allowing for a more
reliable discussion of the $r$-process universality. It is anticipated
that universality may not extend to the elements Sn, Sb, I, and Cs,
making the detection of these elements in metal-poor stars of the utmost
importance to determine the exact conditions of individual $r$-process
events. </td></tr>
