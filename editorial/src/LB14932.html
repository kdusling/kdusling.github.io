<tr><td colspan="2">The second-order azimuthal anisotropy Fourier harmonics, $v_2$, are
obtained in \pPb and \PbPb collisions over a wide pseudorapidity
($\eta$) range based on correlations among six or more charged
particles. The \pPb data, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of
35\nbinv, were collected during the 2013 LHC \pPb run at a
nucleon-nucleon center-of-mass energy of 5.02\TeV by the CMS
experiment. A sample of semi-peripheral \PbPb collision data at
$\rootsNN= 2.76$\TeV, corresponding to an integrated luminosity
of 2.5\mubinv and covering a similar range of particle multiplicities as
the \pPb data, is also analyzed for comparison. The six- and
eight-particle cumulant and the Lee-Yang zeros methods are used to
extract the $v_2$ coefficients, extending previous studies of two- and
four-particle correlations. For both the \pPb and \PbPb systems, the
$v_2$ values obtained with correlations among more than four particles
are consistent with previously published four-particle results. These
data support the interpretation of a collective origin for the
previously observed long-range (large $\Delta\eta$) correlations
in both systems. The ratios of $v_2$ values corresponding to
correlations including different numbers of particles are compared to
theoretical predictions that assume a hydrodynamic behavior of a \pPb
system dominated by fluctuations in the positions of participant
nucleons. These results provide new insights into the multi-particle
dynamics of collision systems with a very small overlapping region. </td></tr>
