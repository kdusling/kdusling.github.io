<tr><td colspan="2">This Letter reports a measurement of the flux and energy spectrum of
electron antineutrinos from six 2.9~GW$_{th}$ nuclear reactors with six 
detectors deployed in two near (effective baselines 512~m and 561~m) and
one far (1,579~m) underground experimental halls in the Daya Bay
experiment. Using 217 days of data, 296,721 and 41,589 inverse beta
decay (IBD) candidates were detected in the near and far halls,
respectively. The measured IBD yield is (1.55 $\pm$ 0.04) $\times$
10$^{-18}$~cm$^2$/GW/day or (5.92 $\pm$ 0.14) $\times$
10$^{-43}$~cm$^2$/fission. This flux measurement is consistent with
previous short-baseline reactor antineutrino experiments and is
$0.946\pm0.022$ ($0.991\pm0.023$) relative to the flux predicted
with the Huber+Mueller (ILL+Vogel) fissile antineutrino model. The
measured IBD positron energy spectrum deviates from both spectral
predictions by more than 2$\sigma$ over the full energy range with a
local significance of up to $\sim$4$\sigma$ between 4-6 MeV. A reactor
antineutrino spectrum of IBD reactions is extracted from the measured
positron energy spectrum for model-independent predictions. </td></tr>
